# MXCP Demo - Presentation Outline for Squirro

## Time Allocation (8-10 minutes)
- Introduction: 1 minute
- Live Demo: 6-7 minutes  
- Squirro Value Props: 2 minutes
- Q&A Buffer: Remaining time

## Key Messages

### 1. Opening Hook
"Turn any database into an AI-accessible knowledge base - securely and with full audit trail"

### 2. Three Main Points
1. **Natural Language Access**: Business users query data without SQL
2. **Enterprise Security**: Data never leaves your control + full audit logs  
3. **Simple Integration**: YAML config, works with any database/AI

### 3. Squirro-Specific Benefits
- Enhance Squirro's cognitive search with structured data access
- Enable customers to query their data naturally
- Maintain compliance with comprehensive audit trails
- Scale from POC to enterprise deployment

## Demo Checkpoints

### âœ… Before Demo
